          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Share2Teach is introduced as a vibrant open educational resource
            (OER) project crafted to nurture a global community of learners and
            educators.
          </p>
          <p>
            At its core lies the principle that knowledge should be accessible,
            collaborative, and freely available. Share2Teach is a testament to
            the power of collective endeavor, co-crafted by students under the
            guidance of their facilitators.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project was initiated by Dr. Chantelle Bosch, a dedicated
            lecturer and sub-area leader for Blended Learning to Enhance
            Self-Directed Learning within the Research Unit Self-Directed
            Learning at the North-West University (NWU).
          </p>
          <p>
            Alongside her, Prof. Dorothy Laubscher, the chair-holder of the
            UNESCO Chair on Multi-modal Learning and OER, has played a pivotal
            role in shaping the vision and trajectory of Share2Teach.
          </p>
          <p>
            Together, a platform has been cultivated where diverse educational
            resources are brought to life, crafted by students for students.
            From comprehensive semester planning documents to topic-specific
            insights, Share2Teach offers a wide array of materials tailored to
            enhance self-directed learning through cooperative learning and
            project-based teaching strategies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Share2Teach serves as a beacon for educational innovation, extending
            an invitation to educators and learners worldwide to contribute,
            explore, and evolve within this open, inclusive community.
          </p>
          <p>
            Joining this journey means participating in the endeavor to
            transform learning into a shared adventure, dismantling barriers and
            erecting bridges toward a more knowledgeable and interconnected
            world.
